#Culinarist's guide to Thuwal

Thuwal is one of the most underexploited tourist destinations. This
magnificent small town offers dozens of options for the traveller keen on buying electronics,
praying, having their hair cut and more.
This short guide is a tribute to the pearl of the Hejazi and the 
restaurants therein.
All names are reported verbatim as they are
written on the street with the exception of the places that have only
arabic signs, in which case an arabic-sounding pseudonym that best
describes the ambience of the restaurant in question has been assigned.

##Al Hamad restaurant

Also formerly known as the ZamZam restaurant. Word of mouth says
that the name got changed as the former owner tragically passed away.
If this is true, Al Hamad restaurant does honor to the old traditions
set forth by the ZamZam. Food is as good as ever and despite the apparent
language barrier, ordering is easy and delivery fast.
They even have a cabinet on the side where westerners can enjoy their food
with their womenfolk in peace.
Especially the lamb curry, biryani and daal are recommended.
A spicy meal of curry and naan costs around 15 SAR.

##The Turkey resteurant.

The turkey resteurant is a neat hole-in-the wall in
the main street of Thuwal. Selection includes tasteful
turkish treats from the grill and the oven. Here 40 SAR
will buy you a massive tray of different meats off the skewer
and a nice side of bread big enough to feed three people.

By the looks of it, they also serve pizzas and tasty boat-shaped
pastries staright off the oven.

They even have an arabic menu and one can place an order in Turkish, Arabic or sign language.
Overall, the quality of the food was more than satisfactory and the service good.

##Bar-B-Que

A classic arabic shawarma hole-in-the wall. This place will serve you a delightful
shawarma for 4 to 5 SAR depending on your preference. The staff speaks little to no english
but sign language will carry you far.

Quality of the shawarma is more than satisfactory, especially if you happen to be a friend
of coriander and cardamom. Size of the portions could be bigger.

##Istanbul restaurant

One of the classier places in downtown Thuwal, this place actually has chairs and tables.
The atmosphere is welcoming to the infrequent westerner. This place serves many kinds of skewers
and tomato based stews. The service was very polite and the young fellow behind the counter speaks
flawless english. The skewers are nice and by the looks of it, the lamb chops seemed really appealing too.
Overall a very tasty treat, although a small negative remark goes to the chewiness of the lamb. One can have a dish
of grilled meat and a salad side with plenty of bread for less than 20 SAR

Cost: 4/5

##Istanbul restanurant

The southern little sibling of the more centrally located Instanbul restaurant.
One can actually see the same guy behind the counter of both restaurants.
Food is quite similar, but the selection slightly smaller than in the Istanbul restaurant.
Four skewers of meat, a side salad, bowl of tsatsiki and more bread than you could hope for
will set you back some 30 SAR.

Cost: 4/5

Taste: 3/5

##Al Mullah Juice shop

The real name of this juice shop eludes the non-arabic speaker, so we will refer to the place as Al Mullah Juice
shop.
The decoration of this less fancy juice shop on the northen side of Thuwal consists of innovative use of
kitsch and use of tin cans as interior elements. Despite the obvious language barrier, the chef was able to
receive and deliver an order of fancy three-layer juice, when given a photo of such a drink on Google Image search.
Compliments to the chef! A juice of the fanciest kind will set you back some 8 SAR.

## Al Habibi Shwarma

This one-in-all place allows you to sample through the fast food scene of Thuwal using a one
pit stop strategy.
Selection is not the widest in Thuwal, but what they have comes in both small and large quantities and
with or without spicy sauce. Atmosphere is welcoming and there are even a few chairs and tables.
The all-in-one style of the restaurant is reflected in the shwarmas that have it all, pickles, lettuce, tomato,
chicken, fries and a rich splatter of mayo. This is definitely not a place for those on a diet.
Service is given with fluent english, two shwarmas and a mango juice will set you back 19 SAR.
