#Culinarist's guide to Thuwal

Thuwal is one of the most underexploited tourist destinations. This
magnificent small town offers dozens of options for the traveller keen on buying electronics,
praying, having their hair cut and more.
This short guide is a tribute to the pearl of the Hejazi and the 
restaurants therein.

All names are reported verbatim as they are
written on the street with the exception of the places that have only
arabic signs, in which case an arabic-sounding pseudonym that best
describes the ambience of the restaurant in question has been assigned.

In addition to this document, relevant location information is also added
to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/5124477)
in order to promote OSM and open data in general.

##Al Hamad restaurant

Also formerly known as the ZamZam restaurant. Word of mouth says
that the name got changed as the former owner tragically passed away.
If this is true, Al Hamad restaurant does honor to the old traditions
set forth by the ZamZam. Food is as good as ever and despite the apparent
language barrier, ordering is easy and delivery fast.
They even have a cabinet on the side where westerners can enjoy their food
with their womenfolk in peace.
Especially the lamb curry, biryani and daal are recommended.
A spicy meal of curry and naan costs around 15 SAR.

##The Turkey resteurant.

The turkey resteurant is a neat hole-in-the wall in
the main street of Thuwal. Selection includes tasteful
turkish treats from the grill and the oven. Here 40 SAR
will buy you a massive tray of different meats off the skewer
and a nice side of bread big enough to feed three people.

By the looks of it, they also serve pizzas and tasty boat-shaped
pastries staright off the oven.

They even have an arabic menu and one can place an order in Turkish, Arabic or sign language.
Overall, the quality of the food was more than satisfactory and the service good.

##Bar-B-Que

A classic arabic shawarma hole-in-the wall. This place will serve you a delightful
shawarma for 4 to 5 SAR depending on your preference. The staff speaks little to no english
but sign language will carry you far.

Quality of the shawarma is more than satisfactory, especially if you happen to be a friend
of coriander and cardamom. Size of the portions could be bigger.

##Istanbul restaurant

One of the classier places in downtown Thuwal, this place actually has chairs and tables.
The atmosphere is welcoming to the infrequent westerner. This place serves many kinds of skewers
and tomato based stews. The service was very polite and the young fellow behind the counter speaks
flawless english. The skewers are nice and by the looks of it, the lamb chops seemed really appealing too.
Overall a very tasty treat, although a small negative remark goes to the chewiness of the lamb. One can have a dish
of grilled meat and a salad side with plenty of bread for less than 20 SAR

##Istanbul restanurant

The southern little sibling of the more centrally located Instanbul restaurant.
One can actually see the same guy behind the counter of both restaurants.
Food is quite similar, but the selection slightly smaller than in the Istanbul restaurant.
Four skewers of meat, a side salad, bowl of tsatsiki and more bread than you could hope for
will set you back some 30 SAR.

##Al Mullah Juice shop

The real name of this juice shop eludes the non-arabic speaker, so we will refer to the place as Al Mullah Juice
shop.
The decoration of this less fancy juice shop on the northen side of Thuwal consists of innovative use of
kitsch and use of tin cans as interior elements. Despite the obvious language barrier, the chef was able to
receive and deliver an order of fancy three-layer juice, when given a photo of such a drink on Google Image search.
Compliments to the chef! A juice of the fanciest kind will set you back some 8 SAR.

## Al Habibi Shwarma

This one-in-all place allows you to sample through the fast food scene of Thuwal using a one
pit stop strategy.
Selection is not the widest in Thuwal, but what they have comes in both small and large quantities and
with or without spicy sauce. Atmosphere is welcoming and there are even a few chairs and tables.
The all-in-one style of the restaurant is reflected in the shwarmas that have it all, pickles, lettuce, tomato,
chicken, fries and a rich splatter of mayo. This is definitely not a place for those on a diet.
Service is given with fluent english, two shwarmas and a mango juice will set you back 19 SAR.

## Broast Taza

In short, Broast Taza is the thing that enables you to eat Al Baik without going all
the way to Jeddah and without being pushed against a sweaty crowd.
Broast Taza serves both deep fried items and soda. What else could a
Thuwali food connoisseur ever need?
In addition to a few kinds of what they call "Borast chicken" they also
serve shrimp and fish, all of which you can eat with the delicious garlic mayonnaise.
15 SAR will buy a meal that contains enough calories to feed the average cambodian
family for a week.

## Al Shweya

Another one of the cryptic places that only advertises in arabic. Contrary
to what the sign outdoors might lead you to believe, the clerk knows numbers and "chicken"
in english perfectly. And what else would you need when buying roasted chicken?
The interior is inviting and provides seating in both the traditional sit-on-the-floor
arabic style as well as in chairs. Grilled chickens sell at a slight discount compared to Tamimi,
costing 16 SAR a piece.

## Al Siyad restaurant

This place might not be the cheapest or the healthiest thuwali restaurant
but they certainly set the standard of what shrimp should taste like.
Walk in, pick your selection of fish and shrimp, select your sides and
come back to collect your fried treat. Like in any good Hejazi restaurant,
you will not be disappointed here because there was too little rice. A large
meal for two served with fluent english will set you back around 100 SAR.

## Al Alyadobe Restaurant

The heart and soul of Thuwali food. This place ranks easily among
the worst in terms of convenience in town. But fear not. One does not
go to a place like Al Alyadobe for convenience. John F. Kennedy
is known to have said
"We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things,
not because they are easy, but because they are hard."
Had JFK known about this restaurant, he surely would have mentioned
about it alongside the lunar flights,
as for an average first world
traveller this place is almost like a lunar landing. Upon entering
the premises, one faces a new world. Bread dough flying through the
air, food being stirred on top of something that is best described as
a huge flame thrower and more. All this carried out by friendly looking
fellas working in the same happy manner as the seven
dwarfs in the Disney classic "Snow White". How to order and in which language
remains as much a mystery as the true name of this restaurant.

One should take this place as more than food, this is an experience.
Without this immersion into the life of a blue collar worker in Saudi,
one truly has not seen Thuwal. As one bounces between the
counters in the restaurant, one sees true masters of their trade using their
stoves and flipping bread off the oven. Worth seeing even if you are not hungry.
A hefty chunk of the best bread in town along with tasty we don't exactly know what
will cost some 12 SAR here.

## 4

Yes. This place is really called "4". Or at least that's the only
character of the western writing system visible on the sign.
This hole in the wall serves you with all things bread, pizza,
flat bread and more. Ordering is easy, inside these guys have a list
of all items being sold along with prices, both in arabic and english.
So off you go poking fingers, come back in 10 minutes and collect your treat.
Food might have some quirks, so keep an open mind. The pizza might
not exactly have tomato sauce in it and the honey on labneh and honey
bread might not have anything to do with bees and flowers, but hey,
we'd expect someone naming their restaurant 4 to take some freedoms regarding the dishes
as well.
A large pizza will set you back some 23 SAR, small bread based treats around 5 SAR each.

## Al Sayed

The fancy place in town. This is where the cream of Thuwal comes 
to be seen. Not the cheapest, but the fanciest.
Pick the fish that fits your liking from a wide variety of options,
along with shrimps and choose from the numerous options of how to prepare them.
Enjoy the seafood with a variety of sides in either the open air
lounge area with men or retreat to the privacy of a booth with
the womefolk of your tribe.
How easy it is to place your order in English depends strongly
on the guy on shift, but in most cases you will get a pretty
decent service in English. In addition, there is a small booth
for the sides where you can go and point fingers and order
that way if you hit the language barrier.
A tasty and a fulfilling meal will cost you upwards from 50 SAR
per person and the waiters are happy to box your leftovers.

## Marhaba Broast

Surely it does not say much, but this is marginally more health conscious choice
than the Taza Broast. In Marhaba Broast you can enjoy deep fried delights
with sugar free soft drinks. The place for the adventurous mind. Upon inspection
an order of chicken nuggets resulted in fish fingers. Like in Taza Broast, all
dishes are accompanied by a hefty amount of fries. The consistency of fried
items is not as crispy as in Taza.

A large dish of deep fried chicken or fish along with mushy fries and some bread will
cost you 12 SAR.

## The Southern Crescent

This joint in the heart of South Thuwal might not seem like
the most easily approachable one, but don't let the appearance fool you.
Inside, the occasional visitor will be greeted with a nice smile
by an old arab gentleman smiling with both of his teeth.
A series of hand-waving and sign language gestures will finally
enable you to place an order. Unfortunately, the full selection
available eludes the non-arabic speaker just as much as the
true name of the restaurant. Glancing over the glass, one may see
bizarre dough bits and flatbread-omelette-constructions being made.
When tried, the sign language random number generator materialised
on what is assumably a chicken liver sandwich. For a measly 2 SAR
a pop, this admittedly shady looking construction offers real value for money
and is recommended for anyone passing through.

## Yalla Falafel

Another place, whose full selection remains a mystery. However, upon
close inspection, the menu does seem to have western numbers on it.
Moreover, these numbers do indicate a bargain. Most of the arabic
gibberish items cost no more than 10 SAR a piece. With a little of 
haggling, the clerk was able to produce a few falafel sandwiches,
with a hint of the Yalla falafel magic sauce.
A small word of critique must be given to the bitter side taste in the
sandwich.

## Fish

Despite what the simplistic name implies, this place actually serves
shrimp too. Traditional pick your fish and how you want it kind of place,
with some seating options as well - at least if you happen to be a man.
Enough so to qualify as one of the poshier
places in Thuwal. Service is carried out with good English, but unfortunately
the delivery of the goods takes quite a bit of time after the smooth ordering process.
Enough so to allow the gentlemen at the deep frying place to ensure a chewy
consistency on the shrimps. Also the shrimp from the oven suffers some handicaps,
being a tad watery and lacking in flavour. A wise shrimp-eater will phone Fish in advance
and show up on scene to pick up the order once it is ready, or simply divert to Siyad.
Two people will fill up with fish at fish starting from around 100 SAR.

## Heena Heena Chicken

The chicken place in town. For the same price as in [Al Shweya](#al-shweya),
one gets rotisserie chicken that beats any competition in town.
The fact that the sign has no English on it and that the door wishes
you "Wellcom" should already tell the client that some trouble
with ordering can be expected. Fortunately, upon inspection
this trouble worked to the advantage of Heena Heena boys and the
rice that was not ordered was quite tasty.

Cost: 3/5

## Aziziyat Habibi

One of the few mid-range places in Thuwal. Atmosphere is kind and inviting,
and in terms of ease, the place is a true double whammy: staff understands
and speaks good english and in addition ordering food can be done pointing
fingers at large and clear colour images that resemble the final product surprisingly much.
Like in so many places, you might want to call your family physician if you
are able to finish the rice. The chicken that goes along with the rice is not only
good price but of good quality as well. Selection includes grilled, rotisserie and
other chicken products. A decent sized meal for two costs around 30 SAR.

##The Pink Cockroach

Named after the little critter crawling on the floor and the colour
of the tiling on the walls, this little restaurant on the side alley
offers the Thuwali culinarist a fine treat of pakistani curry.
Even a more demanding restaurant-goer will find the quality matching
that of Al Hamad, one might even say that this place takes the lead
among Pakistani joints in town, thanks to the fresh roti.
A group of three inspectors ate large dishes of curry and a pile of
delicious Roti for 42 SAR, and placing an order in English was
possible with relative ease.

Cost: 4/5

Taste: 5/5

Ease: 4/5

##The King Fish

This place has practically no customers and opens to the opposite
direction than every restaurant in the neighbourhood is certainly a creepy sight
at first. Perhaps this contributed the fact that King Fish was not at the top
of the list to be tried out. However, an adventurous culinarist will be rewarded
for going the extra mile and stepping into this peculiar establishment.

The staff is not perfectly proficient in english, but luckily they have large colourful
images of the dishes being served hung over the counter. The shrimp barely pales in comparison
against the blue chip establishment in town, Al Siyad, and prices are more affordable too.
A kilo of delicious shrimp will set one back some 70 SAR and if that is enough,
one can always boost the menu in the true Hejazi way, with a massive pile of rice enough
to feed a village; for next to nothing, of course.


Cost: 3/5

Taste: 4/5

Ease: 4/5

## Marlin-S

One of the bigger fish establishments in Thuwal, Marlin-S serves you
shrimp and seafood of their own, or optionally prepares the fish you bring with you.
The grilled fish has its own, interesting seasoning, but for shrimp and rice,
it is recommended to drive further down the road to the fish king.
Service is good, but costly, one should prepare to pay in excess of 100 SAR for
a meal for two.

Cost: 2/5

Taste: 2/5

Ease: 4/5

## Hammour Habibi

One of the less shiny seafood establishments in town, Hammour
Habibi offers the true Hejazi experience: Rice and seafood,
with the classical on-the-floor seating.

The shrimp ranks between Marlin-S and Fish King, leaving room
for the tasty Hammour to fill the role of a signature dish.
Service is not the fastest in town, but one can certainly place
an order in english with relative ease. A filling meal for
two goes for slightly above a hundred riyals.

## Broast Al Baith

The new Broast place in town, this restaurant is living the hype. At the time
of testing, they even had a couple of posh westerners doing their jetsetting there.
A friend of Al Baik will find this place worth a visit, although without
the experience of packing oneself against sweaty bodies while waiting for
your order in a hot room. This broast joint represents the
"Whatever it is, if you can put some mushy fries on it, it'll get better"
school of thought, as manifest in their chicken burgers and sandwiches.
Fortunately, the fried chicken does not share the mushiness of the fries and burgers.
One may comfortably place an order by pointing fingers at a selection of colourful
photos of the dishes. A meal for one, with calories for two, will go for less than
15 SAR.

Cost: 4/5
