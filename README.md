#Culinarist's guide to Thuwal

##The Turkey resteurant.

The turkey resteurant is a neat hole-in-the wall in
the main street of Thuwal. Selection includes tasteful
turkish treats from the grill and the oven. Here 40 SAR
will buy you a massive tray of different meats off the skewer
and a nice side of bread big enough to feed three people.

By the looks of it, they also serve pizzas and tasty boat-shaped
pastries staright off the oven.

They even have an arabic menu and one can place an order in Turkish, Arabic or sign language.
Overall, the quality of the food was more than satisfactory and the service good.

##Bar-B-Que

A classic arabic shawarma hole-in-the wall. This place will serve you a delightful
shawarma for 4 to 5 SAR depending on your preference. The staff speaks little to no english
and there is no menu to point fingers at, luckily they have a glass display
counter that allows one to point different kinds of skewers.

Quality of the shawarma is more than satisfactory, especially if you happen to be a friend
of coriander and cardamom. Size of the portions could be bigger.

##Istanbul restaurant

One of the classier places in downtown Thuwal, this place actually has chairs and tables.
The atmosphere is welcoming to the infrequent westerner. This place serves many kinds of skewers
and tomato based stews. The service was very polite and the young fellow behind the counter speaks
flawless english. The skewers are nice and by the looks of it, the lamb chops seemed really appealing too.
Overall a very tasty treat, although a small negative remark goes to the chewiness of the lamb. One can have a dish
of grilled meat and a salad side with plenty of bread for less than 20 SAR

Cost: 4/5

Taste: 3/5

Ease: 5/5

##Al Mullah Juice shop

The real name of this juice shop eludes the non-arabic speaker, so we will refer to the place as Al Mullah Juice
shop.
The decoration of this less fancy juice shop on the northen side of Thuwal consists of innovative use of
kitsch and use of tin cans as interior elements. Despite the obvious language barrier, the chef was able to
receive and deliver an order of fancy three-layer juice, when given a photo of such a drink on Google Image search.
Compliments to the chef! A juice of the fanciest kind will set you back some 8 SAR.
